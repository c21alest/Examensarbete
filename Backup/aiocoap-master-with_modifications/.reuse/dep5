# We *could* just go with `*` here, but I rather prefer being explicit about
# what's in here to guard against accidentally added files.
#
# This list should include all checked in files that are not Python files. For
# those, having the headers in is at least how we've been doing it a long time,
# is more aligned with what reuse.software recommends. But for all those config
# files, JSON examples etc, having comments in there in each config file's
# specific comment format (if any) is cumbersome.
